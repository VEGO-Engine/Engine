# Welcome to the VEGO library documentation

Here you will (hopefully) find any information necessary to use the different classes and components of this engine to develop your own simple 2D games.

Alternatively you could also just look at the code in the templates include and src folders and look at the example implementations there. The best place to start is `GameImplementation.h` and  `GameImplementation.cpp`. All .cpp files have an associated .h file, please always start in the .h file with the same name as the .cpp file, otherwise you might get confused at some of the inline explanations provided in the files.

> [!note]
> When navigating this documentation click on hyperlinks if you ever feel like information is missing (there is usually more information available in the detailed view only visible if you click it or scroll far enough)

The base functionality can be split into a few major sections:
### Setup and Config
1. [Quickstart guide for setting up the library](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2quickstart)
2. [Configuring game settings](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2config)
3. [Building a map using Tiled and tmx and loading it](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2tilemaps)
### Implementation of Features
4. [Entities and Components](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2entitiesAndComponents)
5. [Input Management](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2inputhandling)
6. [Eventhandling](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2eventhandling)

You can also of course just browse the classes on your own this just act as a more structured separation and docuementation of relevant features

DISCLAIMER: EVERYTHING IN THE GIVEN TEMPLATE CODE IS OPTIONAL EVERYTHING FOUND IN THERE IS JUST A GUIDE AND CAN BE CHANGED AND/OR DELETED WITHOUT A PROBLEM
