# Welcome to the VEGO library documentation

Here you will (hopefully) find any information necessary to use the different classes and components of this engine to develop your own simple 2D games.

The base functionality can be split into a few major sections:
- [Quickstart guide for setting up the library](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2quickstart)
- [Building an environment using Tiled and tmx](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2tilemaps)
- [Entities and Components](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2entitiesAndComponents)
- [Input Management](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2inputhandling)
- [Eventhandling](@ref md_docs_2md-pages_2eventhandling)

You can also of course just browse the classes on your own this just act as a more structured separation and docuementation of relevant features

Example code and quick start docu for each relevant function can be found within the template files themselves, use GameImplementation.cpp as a starting point.
