# Interactions

In order to make an entity react to interactions it needs to include an implementation of InteractionListener such as the InteractionComponent. Using [its constructor](@ref InteractionComponent#InteractionComponent) you can add a lambda/function pointer containing what you want to happen once an interaction with this entity happens.
