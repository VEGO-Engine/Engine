 * \class Textures
 * \brief Forward declaration of the \c Textures enum class.
 *
 * The \c Textures enum class is intended to be implemented within the game scope.
 * This allows for customized texture entries to be defined based on the specific needs of the project.
 * The base declaration ensures that the enum class can be referenced and used consistently throughout
 * the engine while leaving the details of the texture identifiers up to the implementation.
 * \sa \ref TextureManager "TextureManager" for how the enum is used.
